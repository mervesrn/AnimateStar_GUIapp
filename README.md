# Animate
In this labwork I writed a GUI application using AWT And Swing. I animate a shooting star which gets smaller and bigger with time. 
 To do this application;<br>
• Have a gradient paint background of your liking. I have used Color.getHSBColor( 0.75f, 0.8f, 0.3f ) and Color.getHSBColor( 0.65f, 0.8f, 0.5f ) .<br>
• A star shape that is filled with a color. (You can use GeneralPath)<br>
• Modify the action listener so that it modifies scale of the star which is either increasing or
decreasing by delta with time.<br>
• Set the title to “Shooting Star”.<br>
• Modify your paint method to draw a star and scale it.<br>
• The main method should create and display an instance of Animate().<br>
• The frame should be set to the size 400 by 400.<br>
• Submit only one file called Animate.java.<br>
